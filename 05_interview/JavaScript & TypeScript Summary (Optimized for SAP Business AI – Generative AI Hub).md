## 1. JavaScript / TypeScript Core

- **Asynchronous Model:**  
  Deep understanding of the event loop, including microtasks (`Promise.resolve`) and macrotasks (`setTimeout`),  
  as well as Node.js–specific queues (`process.nextTick`).  
  Can reason about asynchronous code execution order and non-blocking I/O behavior.

- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+):**  
  Fluent with module systems (`import/export`), destructuring, arrow functions, template literals,  
  and `async/await` patterns.

- **Object-Oriented & Functional Patterns:**  
  Comfortable applying OOP principles such as encapsulation (`private`, `protected`), inheritance,  
  and method overriding. Uses closures and higher-order functions where appropriate.

## 2. TypeScript for Production

- **Type-Safe API Design:**  
  Experienced with `interface`, `type`, and generics to model data contracts and DTOs in backend systems.  
  Actively uses utility types such as `Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Record`, and `Readonly` to ensure code reusability and safety.

- **Strict TypeScript Configuration:**  
  Works under strict compiler settings (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`)  
  to guarantee compile-time safety and prevent runtime type mismatches.

- **Advanced Type Handling:**  
  Familiar with `never`, `unknown`, and conditional types to implement precise type narrowing and input validation.  
  Uses type guards and discriminated unions for safe runtime checks.

- **Testing and Build Integration:**  
  Configures TypeScript build pipelines and integrates with testing tools (Jest/Vitest) to ensure consistency  
  between compile-time and runtime validation.

## 3. Node.js & Cloud-Native Integration

- **Node.js Backend Development:**  
  Proficient in developing RESTful APIs and CLI tools using TypeScript with Node.js (Express/Fastify).  
  Strong understanding of asynchronous patterns, event-driven architecture, and error propagation.

- **CI/CD Automation:**  
  Builds and deploys Node.js applications through GitHub Actions.  
  Experience setting up pipelines for `npm install`, `lint`, `test`, `build`, and container deployment (`docker build & push`).

- **Containerization and Cloud-Native Concepts:**  
  Familiar with Docker image creation, environment configuration, and Kubernetes-based deployment pipelines.  
  Understands how to design scalable microservices and integrate with distributed systems.

---

## 4. Collaboration & AI Context

- **AI/LLM Integration Awareness:**  
  Understanding of RESTful and SDK-based integration patterns for AI and Large Language Models.  
  Experienced with designing data structures that safely handle LLM responses and metadata using TypeScript.

- **Agile Collaboration:**  
  Experienced in Scrum-based teamwork within SAP (sprints, reviews, stand-ups).  
  Practices code review, branching, and pull request workflows to ensure maintainability and team productivity.

- **Communication:**  
  Fluent in English, with experience writing clear technical documentation,  
  and communicating complex ideas in a collaborative and multicultural environment.

## 5. Tooling & Ecosystem

- **Core Tools:** Node.js, TypeScript, GitHub Actions, Docker, Jest, ESLint, Prettier  
- **Familiar Concepts:** Cloud-native architectures, CI/CD pipelines, and AI service integration

**Focus Areas for Continuous Growth:**  
1. Deepen understanding of Node.js runtime internals (streams, worker threads).  
2. Expand automation coverage in CI/CD for large-scale monorepos.  
3. Explore advanced TypeScript patterns (conditional & infer-based typing for SDK design).
