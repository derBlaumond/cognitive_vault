0:00Welcome to Machine Learning.

0:06What is machine learning?

0:08You probably use it many times a day without even knowing it.

0:12Anytime you want to find out something like,

0:14How do I make a sushi roll?

0:16You can do a web search on Google, Bing, or Baidu to find out.

0:20And that works so well because the machine learning software has figured out how to rank web pages.

0:27Or when you upload pictures to Instagram or Snapchat and think to yourself,

0:32I want to tag my friends so they can see their pictures.

0:35Well, these apps can recognize your friends in your pictures and label them as well.

0:40That's also machine learning.

0:42Or if you've just finished watching a Star Wars movie on the video streaming service and you think,

0:48What other similar movies do I watch?

0:50Well, the streaming service will likely use machine learning to recommend something that you might like.

0:56Each time you use voice to text on your phone to write a text message,

1:00Hey Andrew, how's it going?

1:02Or tell your phone, Hey Siri, play a song by Rihanna.

1:05Or ask your other phone, Okay Google, show me Indian restaurants near me.

1:10That's also machine learning.

1:13Each time you receive an email titled, Congratulations, you've won a million dollars.

1:18Well, maybe a rich congratulations.

1:20Or more likely your email service will probably flag it as spam.

1:25That too is an application of machine learning.

1:29Beyond consumer applications that you might use,

1:32AI is also rapidly making its way into big companies and into industrial applications.

1:38For example, I'm deeply concerned about climate change.

1:42And I'm glad to see that machine learning is already hoping to optimize wind turbine power generation.

1:50Or in healthcare, it's starting to make its way into hospitals to help doctors make accurate diagnoses.

1:57Or recently, at Learning AI, I've been doing a lot of work putting computer vision into factories

2:03to help inspect if something coming off the assembly line has any defects.

2:08That's machine learning.

2:11It's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

0:02In this class, you'll learn about the state-of-the-art and also practice implementing machine learning algorithms yourself.

0:09You'll learn about the most important machine learning algorithms, some of which are exactly what's being used in large AI or large tech companies today, and you'll get a sense of what is the state-of-the-art in AI.

0:22Beyond learning the algorithms, though, in this class, you'll also learn all the important practical tips and tricks for making them perform well, and you get to implement them and see how they work for yourself.

0:35So, why is machine learning so widely used today?

0:40Machine learning had grown up as a subfield of AI or artificial intelligence.

0:45We wanted to build intelligent machines, and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from A to B, like in your GPS.

0:56But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays, or build a self-driving car.

1:10The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself.

1:17For me, when I founded and was leading the Google Brain team, I worked on problems like speech recognition, computer vision for Google Maps Street View images, and advertising.

1:28Or, leading AI at Baidu, I worked on everything from AI for augmented reality to combating payment fraud to leading a self-driving car team.

1:38Most recently, at Lanning AI, an AI fund at Stanford University, I've been getting to work on AI applications in manufacturing, large-scale agriculture, healthcare, e-commerce, and other problems.

1:50Today, there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people working on machine learning applications who could tell you similar stories about their work with machine learning.

1:59When you've learned these skills, I hope that you too will find it great fun to dabble in exciting different applications in maybe even different industries.

2:08In fact, I find it hard to think of any industry that machine learning is unlikely to touch in a significant way now or in the near future.

2:17Looking even further into the future, many people, including me, are excited about the AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as you or me.

2:28This is sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI.

2:33I think AGI has been overhyped and we're still a long way away from that goal.

2:39I don't know if it'll take 50 years or 500 years or longer to get there, but most AI researchers believe that the best way to get closer to that goal is by using learning algorithms, maybe ones that take some inspiration from how the human brain works.

2:56You'll also hear a little more about this quest for AGI later in this course.

3:01According to a study by McKinsey, AI and machine learning is estimated to create an additional $13 trillion of value annually by the year 2030.

3:14Even though machine learning is already creating tremendous amounts of value in the software industry, I think there could be even vastly greater value that is yet to be created outside the software industry.

3:26In sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials manufacturing, and so on.

3:34Because of the massive untapped opportunities across so many different sectors, today there is a vast unfulfilled demand for this skill set.

3:44That's why this is such a great time to be learning about machine learning.

3:49If you find machine learning applications exciting, I hope you stick with me through this course.

3:56I can almost guarantee that you'll find mastering these skills worthwhile.

4:01In the next video, we'll look at a more formal definition of what is machine learning.

4:08And we'll begin to talk about the main types of machine learning problems and algorithms.

4:13You pick up some of the main machine learning terminology and start to get a sense of what are the different algorithms and when each one might be appropriate.

4:24So, let's go on to the next video.
