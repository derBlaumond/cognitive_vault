### Math operators
 
- [Instructor] Computers are really good at computing as in doing math and in JavaScript, you'll often have to do math to convert or combine or subtract or multiply or divide values or do other things. For all of this we have standard arithmetic math operators. In the exercise files I've set up an example so we can play around with this. So you can see it here. We've set up some lets with different values. Let me just output those lets into the console so we can see what they are. And then we have this lets called results down here where we can do a math operation and the result is placed inside the result let and then we just output it. So right now we are doing an addition using the plus symbols. So we are taking the value of A plus the value of B the result is nine because it's five plus four. We can also do a subtraction by putting in a minus symbol. This gives us A minus B the result is one. If we want to do division, you put in a forward slash this becomes A divided by B that's 1.25, five divided by four. And finally, we can do multiplication by adding an asterisk. So A times B five times four equals 20. You can also do more advanced arithmetic here so we can wrap this in parenthesis and then say A times B divided by. And then we can add in a number, so we can say two. So you remember A times B five times four is 20. And if I divided that by two, we get 10. We can also pass in another value here so I can pass it in the C value, which is 3.2, run that and we get 6.25. So using these standard arithmetic operators, you can do pretty advanced math, right inside JavaScript. In addition to addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, we have some more advanced operators we can use. One is, this one, a percentage symbol this signifies a modulo or modulus, and it gives us the remainder left over when we divide the first number by the second number. So in this case, we're dividing five by four. This will give us one instance of four, and then we have one left over. So the modulus will give us one. If I then change the value here to 10, you'll see what I mean. So 10 divided by four gives us two times four which is eight. And then we have two leftover, save that and we get three. If I change it to 15, we get four by four by, four plus four plus four, which is 12. And that gives us three remainder, right? Save that and we get three. Modulus is useful when you're doing things like testing for prime value or other things. And it is something that's often used in math. We can also do exponentiation so if we have 15 and we want to say 15 to the power of four, we can use two asterisks like this star star. So A asterisk, asterisk B is A so 15 to the of power B four. Save that, and we get a huge number, 50,625. Now there's one thing that you often do in JavaScript which falls a little bit outside of normal math. And that is, you often have a number and then you want to increment it or decremented by one. So you want to add one to the number or you want to take one away from that number. Because this is so common, we have a specialized formula for it in JavaScript and it works a little bit differently. So take a look at this, if I go down into the results here, and I say, plus plus A, what do you think the result will be over here? Now A is 15, but when I save this, the output is 16 because I've taken A, and that I've incremented by one. If I add two minus symbols in front of it instead, I get 14 because I took A and then I took one away. But it gets more interesting than that because sometimes you don't want to add the number first. You want to do something with the number and then add an increment afterwards. For that we can say A plus, plus. Now, if I run this in the browser you'll see we get 15 as a result but we also added that plus plus. To see what happens, I can then console log out just A, when I save this you'll see A is now 16. So what happened is I took A then output the value 15, then I incremented it. So then the next time we use A it'll be 16 instead. So this is an easy way of incrementing or decrementing a number. And by placing the plus symbol either before or after the value, we can control how that value comes out and when the instrumentation happens. One more thing worth noting here, and I need to reset my example. Remember how I said JavaScript often interprets a single number inside a string as the number itself. Well, things get weird if you try to mix true numbers with string numbers and then use the plus symbol for addition. So if I go up here you can see right now it says 15 and 14, right? So A and B it's 15 plus 14, save it and we get 19. What happens if I put quotation marks around the four? And you'll remember if I did a comparison here from between A and B and A is a number and B as a string with just a number four, JavaScript, we'll go, sure they're the same. But, if I do this using the plus symbol, look what happens. I get the number 44. That's because the plus symbol in this context is used as a string combiner. So we are putting the number from A next to the number from B. If I put 15 as the value in A here, it will say the number we get out is one, five, four, which is confusing. What is even more confusing is this only happens for the plus symbol. So if I used a minus symbol instead, then JavaScript will still interpret B, which is a string as a number. So if I save this, we suddenly get 11 that's, 15 minus four. And so this issue around making two numbers placing next to one another only happens with the plus symbol. That means when you're doing math, using JavaScript and you are doing addition, you have to make sure you're actually operating with real numbers and not strings. Otherwise you get weird output that makes no sense From a math perspective.

### Arrays in code
 
- [Instructor] An array is an instance of the array object and we declare a new array by creating a variable then using square brackets to wrap around a comma separated list of each of the items within that array. So each of these items take up a slot in the array. If we console.log out an array in the browser, you can see here we have an array with four items and we got a list of all four of those items and you clearly see that we can mix different data types with the same array, so we have a string, we have a variable that pulls in the string, and we have a number and we then have a boolean value. Also notice at the bottom we have a property in the array, and it's the length property that gives us the total length of the array. So if I instead go here and say collection.length then we just get the number signifying how long that array is and how many items are in the array. To access a specific item within an array, we need to use the index number for the slot in the array. You'll notice here that the index actually starts with zero. So the first item at the index number is zero, the second item has the index number one, and so on. That means if I want to get ahold of the second item, I need to call for index number one. I do that using the same square brackets. So I'll say square brackets one, that is the index number. And when I do this I get the value of slot number two. In this case that's the variable that has the contents flashlight so that's why we're seeing flashlight in the console. We can assign new values to any of these slots using the same technique. So if I want to add a different value to the third slot, that'd be index number two, all I'd have to do is call in that slot. So collection square bracket two. That gives me the third slot, and then I'll set it equal to whatever I want to put in there instead. So I'll put in camera, save, and now when I expand again you'll see the third item, index number two, is set to camera instead. So even though the original slot was a number, I can swap it out for a string or anything else at any time because Java Script does not care about the data type inside any of these slots. Just like you can place any data type inside a variable, you can place any data type inside any slot in an array. String, a number, a boolean value, an undefined value, a null value, a true or false value, even an object or another array. Now let's say you want to add a new item to the end of the array. You can do that using this length property because the length property, you notice, has the same number as the next imagined item in this array. So the length is four. That means if I want to add a new item to the end, I can just say collection and then inside the square brackets I'll say collection again, and a length. This will give me the current length of the array and then I'll set that equal to new item. Save that, now our array is five items long and the new item has a slot number four, which is the number we got out of collection.length. Interestingly you can also assign a new item to a slot that doesn't exist yet that's further down the chain. So for example, we can say collection and then let's say nine. This is further down on the list and there aren't numbers eight, seven, six and five yet, but let's see what happens. So I'll say at the end and click save. Now our array has 10 slots, but if we look at the list we only get one, two, three, four, five, six. So what happened to slots five through eight? Well, we can try to output them and see what they say. Console.log collection and then say eight. Save that and what we get is undefined. That's what we'll get for all of those undefined slots because they are quite literally undefined. We never defined them so they are undefined. There's nothing in there and we can't pull anything out, but we can assign new values to them at any time because, like I said, Java Script doesn't care if we mix data types, so we can swap out a undefined for anything else. What you see here is arrays are an extremely flexible data storage method. We can very quickly access content, we can add new content, we can replace content, and pretty much do whatever we want with it. Arrays also have a long list of methods we can use to do more advanced things and we'll look at that in the next movie.

### Array methods
 
- [Instructor] Arrays are used a lot in JavaScript. So there's a whole array of array methods to do things with arrays and their contents. All of these methods are heavily documented with examples in the MDN web docs. You can find them under static methods and instance methods. And this whole page is well-worth a read once you're finished with the course. In the meantime, let's look at some of these methods in more detail. In the exercise files for this movie, I've set up a basic array called backpackContents. It contains three items: piggy, headlamp, and pen, and when we output it, you see them over here in the browser. All right. So far, nothing new. A very common thing we want to do with an array is just output all of these values in the array as a string. This can be done using the join method and the join method is added directly to the object itself. So I'll just say .join, and then call it as a method by putting the parentheses at the end. Save. And now we get a comma-separated list of each of the items. The problem is, this looks weird, right? Because there's no space between here. So I can pass in a parameter saying what type of separator I want. So if I want a comma-separated list but I want some space, I say comma space. Save. And now we have comma space. Of course, I can pass in something else, too. Space pipe space. So here you have full control over how you want to output those items. Also note, the join method outputs a string. So once we've done this, we now have a string that we can work with just like any other string. Another common task is to add one or more new items to the end of the array. Now, in the previous movie, you saw we can do this by grabbing the array length and then just appending more content. But we can also use a method to do this and the method is more secure because we're not risking overriding anything in the array. That method is called push because we're pushing more items onto the array. So we'll grab our array, backpackContents.push and then we provide a comma-separated list of all the items we want to add. So here I want to add a pencil and I want to add the number five. Save. And now my array has five items: piggy headlamp, pen, pencil and the number five. Push adds new items to the end of the array. If I wanted to add the new items to the front of the array instead, I use a method called unshift. Now, it sounds a little weird, unshift, and I'll explain why it's called unshift in a second, but let's just see what happens if I do this first. Unshift... Sorry, spell it correctly. Unshift, save. And now we can see the pencil and five are added to the top of the array, the front of the array, slot number zero and number one. So why is this method called unshift? Well, there's a simple reason. The shift method takes the first item off the array. So right now, the array has the piggy as the first item. If I say backpackContents shift and save it, piggy is lost. We've taken piggy off the front of the array. If I want to take something off the back of the array, so the last item, in this case pen, I use a method called pop instead cause I'm literally popping the item off the array. Now we have piggy and headlamp. Now, all of these methods are fairly straightforward. We either just apply them directly to the array object or we apply them and pass on some parameters to do something. In addition, many array methods allow us to do more advanced things like apply functions to each item within the array. So let's see how that works. What I want to do here is add an L-I around each of the items and then output them to the console. To do that, I'm going to wipe out this example and then copy in this commented-out section down here and then take off the comments. Here, I'm going to use the For Each loop. So the For Each loop will grab each item and do something to that item. The For Each loop doesn't do anything to the array itself; it just loops through the array to do something. So here we say backpackContents for each item. Then we run a function on each of those items, passing the item itself in as the parameter. And what we're doing here is setting up the item equal to list item plus the item plus end list item. And then we just console log that out in the browser. Save that. And now we get a list. So, piggy with L-I before and after, head lamp with L-I before and after, and so on. So the For Each loop gives us the ability of manipulating the contents within the array and then doing something with those contents outside of the array without touching the array itself. You'll see down here, the array is still the same. We didn't touch it. There's another example here. If we copy that out and paste it in and un-comment it, this one is a little bit different. I'm just going to comment out my For Each example, as well. Here, we're doing something else and even more advanced. We're saying we'll create a new let and then we go to backpackContents to find the first item that meets our parameters and the parameters are defined inside a custom function. The function grabs each item in turn, and then it says, if this item has a length that is bigger than or equal to five, meaning there are five or more characters in that item, then return the item. And this will return the first item that meets this requirement. Save. And we get in return piggy. We can then test it by saying, what if we just call it pig, save, and this time we get headlamp in return. So here you can see, using some of these array functions, we can apply new functions to the individual items within the array, or we can customize the array in pretty much any way we want. As I mentioned, there are a ton of methods for arrays, and you can see a list of all of them in the MDN web docs, where you can also see code example for how to use each of them.

### Set: Arrays with Unique Items
The backpack featured in this course is the backpack I use any time I go on a trip and need to bring my laptop and other equipment.

Every time our family travels, my wife and I both make lists: arrays of items we need to pack. Those arrays ensure we don't forget anything, but if we're not careful, we end up adding the same item multiple times. To avoid this, we could combine the arrays into one, and then manually remove any duplicates. Or, we could use Set.

The Set object in JavaScript stores unique values of any type, with an emphasis on unique. You can't have the same value more than once in a Set. This makes it perfect for storing a collection of unique items, like the items in our packing list. Unlike an array where items are ordered and you access them by their index number, the items in a Set are unordered and cannot be accessed randomly.

Here's what our packing list looks like as a Set:
```js
const itemsToPack = new Set();
itemsToPack.add("water bottle");
itemsToPack.add("laptop");
itemsToPack.add("headphones");
itemsToPack.add("snacks");
itemsToPack.add("book");
itemsToPack.add("sunscreen");
```
The Set is created using the new Set() constructor. We then add items to the Set using the add() method. The Set object has several methods to help you manage the collection of items:

- add(): Adds a new item to the Set

- has(): Checks if an item exists in the Set

- delete(): Removes an item from the Set

- size(): Returns the number of items in the Set

Once a Set has been created, we can use the above methods to modify it. For example, we can check if an item is in the Set and add it if it's not:
```js
if (!itemsToPack.has("water bottle")) {
 itemsToPack.add("water bottle");
} else {
 console.log("Water bottle is already on the list!");
}
```
Accessing specific items within a Set 
Set is often referred to as arrays with unique items (as in the title of this article), but this mental model may lead you astray until you get a full grasp on when to use a Set over an array. Specifically, one of the first things you probably want to know is how to access specific items within a Set.

When you feel this urge, ask yourself: Why do I need access to that specific item beyond knowing it's there (for which there is the has() method described above)? Chances are, if you're asking that question, you shouldn't be using a Set:

- If you need to access items by index, you should probably be using an array

- If you need to access items by key, you should probably be using an Object

- If you need to access items by value, you should probably be using a Map

Set is specifically for when you need to store a collection of unique items and then perform operations on that collection.

So what are the uses of Set then? Let's return to our packing list example. Once we have a list of all the items we need to pack, we can use the forEach() method to loop through the items and check to make sure they're actually packed:
```js
const backpack1.items = ["water bottle", "laptop"];
const backpack2.items = [ "headphones", "snacks", "book"];

itemsToPack.forEach(item => {
   if (backpack1.items.includes(item)) {
       console.log(`${item} is packed in backpack 1`);
   } else if (backpack2.items.includes(item)) {
       console.log(`${item} is packed in backpack 2`);
   } else {
       console.log(`${item} is not packed`);
   }
});
```
Run this code and you'll see which backpack contains which item from the list (and that we once again forgot to pack the sunscreen).

Set is one of those features you don't see a use for until you suddenly need it. It's a powerful tool for managing collections of unique items, and provides a quick and straightforward way of ensuring you don't have duplicates in your data, and removing them if you do.
