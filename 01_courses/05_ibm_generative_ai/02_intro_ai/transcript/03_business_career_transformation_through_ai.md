## AI Agents
[MUSIC] Welcome to AI agents. After watching this video, you will be able to explain what AI agents are and discuss the characteristics and types of AI agents. Additionally, you will be able to explore multi-agent systems and the various applications of AI agents. Did you know? The global AI market is expected to increase to $1.8 trillion within the next seven years with a staggering compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 36.6%. According to Gartner, using AI agents in customer service will save companies around $80 billion by reducing labor costs. Understanding AI agents is crucial as it enables various businesses to use automation and data-driven decision making, further improving efficiency, innovation, and competitiveness in the respective fields. 

Let's define what AI agents are. AI agents are software programs that interact with their environment, collect and process data, and perform tasks on their own to achieve the goals set by humans. They can make decisions, solve problems and adapt to new information without needing constant human help. So how do AI agents work? Let's take the example of a self-driving car. It includes several key phrases, perception, where AI agents use sensors like cameras and radar in a car to gather data about the environment, spotting vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs. By understanding phase algorithms process this data to identify objects, their speed and movement. 

Then you have decision-making where the agent uses a knowledge base and logic and determines when to accelerate, brake, or turn. Further, in action phase, actuators execute these decisions, controlling the car's steering and brakes to navigate safely. Finally, learning phase, where the agent improves over time using machine learning, analyzing past experiences to enhance performance. For a self-driving car, this means continually learning from its driving experiences. AI agents possess several key characteristics such as social ability, autonomy, reactiveness, and proactiveness. Social ability refers to an agent's capacity to communicate and collaborate with other agents and entities in its environment. Autonomy is the agent's ability to operate independently and make decisions without external help. 

Reactiveness allows agents to respond immediately to changes in their environment, while proactiveness enables them to take initiative and make decisions to achieve their objectives. Let's discuss the areas where each of the characteristics can be used. The social ability feature of AI agents is extensively used in the healthcare sector. In healthcare, chatbots use social skills to give medical advice, check symptoms, and schedule appointments and reminders. Self driving cars use the autonomy feature to navigate roads, make driving decisions, and operate without human assistance. Reactiveness is employed in thermostats, which adjust home temperatures depending on real-time data. In industries, predictive maintenance systems use the reactiveness feature to analyze equipment data and schedule maintenance before breakdowns occur. 

In today's fast changing tech world, managing and coordinating many independent systems is becoming more important. The need appears in different areas, like managing resources spread over a large area, operating smart transportation systems, and creating complex simulations. This is where multi-agent systems come in. In multi-agent systems, multiple agents work together to achieve individual and collective goals. Multi-agent systems enable distributed problem-solving, cooperative decision-making, and emergent behaviors from agent interactions. These multi-agent systems are used in various fields, including online marketplaces, robotic coordination, and traffic management. In online marketplaces, buyer and seller agents negotiate prices and manage transactions for their users, facilitating efficient and automated commerce. 

In robotic coordination, teams of robots collaborate on complex tasks such as warehouse logistics or search and rescue missions. In traffic management, agents representing autonomous cars communicate to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. In today's digital age, tech giants employ AI agents in their services and products. Google integrates AI agents into YouTube for content recommendation and moderation, analyzing user behavior to suggest videos and manage content. Additionally, AI agents help in detecting and removing inappropriate content, enforcing community guidelines, and managing copyright issues. In Gmail, AI agents power features like smart compose and smart reply, which suggest responses based on the email's content. The AI agents also help organize emails, filter out spam, and find important messages. 

Google Maps uses AI agents for real-time navigation, gathering real time-data from various sources to provide accurate route recommendations, estimate travel times, and offer alternative routes to avoid traffic jams. Amazon's Alexa uses AI for voice recognition, understanding natural language, and controlling smart home devices. The Amazon.com e-commerce platform uses AI to recommend products, improve search results, and manage inventory. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, offers AI services for developers such as machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision tools. As we enter a new era, AI agents are becoming more than just tools. They are partners in making strategic decisions and engaging with customers. Their impact will continue to increase. 

With this, you've reached the end of the video. In this video, you learned that agents in AI are software programs that engage with surroundings, process data, and autonomously carry out tasks to meet human-defined goals. You also learned about the key traits of AI agents. Social ability means agents can talk and work with others, autonomy means they can work alone and decide things by themselves. Reactiveness lets them quickly react to changes, and proactiveness means they can take charge and make decisions to reach their goals. Finally, you learned that multi-agent systems facilitate distributed problem-solving and cooperative decision-making, and how the same can be applied in varied areas such as online marketplaces, robotic coordination, and traffic management. [MUSIC]

## What Are AI Agents?
2024 will be the year of AI agents. So what are AI agents? And to start explaining that, we have to look at the various shifts that we're seeing in the field of generative AI. And the first shift I would like to talk to you about is this move from monolithic models to compound AI systems. So models on their own are limited by the data they've been trained on. So that impacts what they know about the world and what sort of tasks they can solve. They are also hard to adapt, so you could tune a model, but it would take an investment in data and in resources. 

So let's take a concrete example to illustrate this point. I want to plan a vacation for this summer, and I want to know how many vacation days are at my disposal. What I can do is take my query, feed that into a model that can generate a response. I think we can all expect that this answer will be incorrect because the model doesn't know who I am and does not have access to this sensitive information about me. So they can help with summarizing documents, they can help me with creating first drafts for emails and different reports I'm trying to do. But the magic gets unlocked when I start building systems around the model and actually take the model and integrate them into to the existing processes I have. So if we were to design a system to solve this, I would have to give the model access to the database where my vacation data is stored. 

So that same query would get fed into the language model. The difference now is the model would be prompted to create a search query, and that would be a search query that can go into the database that I have. So that would go and fetch the information from the database, output an answer, and then that would go back into the model that can generate a sentence to answer. So Maya, you have ten days left in your vacation database. So the answer that I would get here would be correct. This is an example of a compound AI system, and it recognizes that certain problems are better solved when you apply the principles of system design. So what does that mean by the term system? 

You can understand there's multiple components, so systems are inherently modular. I can have a model, I can choose between tuned models, large language models, image generation models, but also I have programmatic components that can come around it. So I can have output verifiers, I can have programs that can take a query and then break it down to increase the chances of the answer being correct. I can combine that with searching databases, I can combine that with different tools. So when we talking about a system approaches, I can break down what I desire my program to do and pick the right components to be able to solve that. And this is inherently easier to solve for than tuning a model. So that makes this much faster and quicker to adapt. 

Okay, so the example I used below is an example of a compound AI system. You also might be popular with retrieval augmented generation, which is one of the most popular and commonly used compound AI systems out there. Most rag systems and the example I used below are defined in a certain way. So if I bring a very different query, let's say I ask about the weather. In this example here, it's going to fail, because the path that this program has to follow is to always search my vacation policy database, and that has nothing to do with the weather. So when we say the path to answer a query, we are talking about something called the control logic of a program. So, compound AI systems, we said most of them have programmatic control logic. 

So that was something that I defined myself as the human. Now let's talk about where do agents come in? One other way of controlling the logic of a compound AI system is to put, put a large language model in charge. And this is only possible because we're seeing tremendous improvements in the capabilities of reasoning of large language models. So large language models, you can feed them complex problems, and you can prompt them to break them down and come up with a plan on how to tackle it. Another way to think about it is on one end of the spectrum, I'm telling my system to think fast, act as programmed, don't deviate from the instructions I've given you. And on the other end of the spectrum, you're designing your system to think slow. 

So create a plan. Attack each part of the plan, see where you get stuck, see if you need to readjust the plan. So I might give you a complex question, and if you would just give me the first answer that pops into your head, very likely that answer might be wrong, but you have higher chances of success if you break it down. Understand, where do you need external help to solve some parts of the problem, and maybe take an afternoon to solve it? And when we put LLMs in charge of the logic, this is when we're talking about an agentic approach. So let's break down the components of LLM agents. The first capability is the ability to reason, which we talked about. 

So this is putting the model at the core of how problems are being solved. The model will be prompted to come up with a plan and to reason about each step of the process along the way. Another capability of agents is the ability to act, and this is done by external programs that are known in the industry as tools. So tools are external pieces of the program, and the model can define when to call them and how to call them in order to best execute the solution to the question they've been asked. So an example of a tool could be search, searching the web, searching a database at their disposal. Another example could be a calculator to do some math. This could be a piece of program code that maybe might manipulate a database. 

This can also be another language model that maybe you're trying to do a translation task and you want a model that can be able to do that. And there's so many other possibilities of what can do there. So these could be APIs, basically any piece of external program you want to give your model access to. Third capability, that is the ability to access memory. And the term memory can mean a couple of things. So we talked about the models, thinking through the program, kind of how you think out loud when you're trying to solve through a problem. So those inner logs can be stored and can be useful to retrieve at different points in time. 

But also this could be the history of conversations that you as a human had when interacting with the agent, and that would allow to make the experience much more personalized. So the way of configuring AI agents, there's many ways to approach it. One of the more most popular ways of going about it is through something called react, which as you can tell by the name, combines the reasoning and act components of LLM agents. So let's make this very concrete. What happens when I configure a react agent? You have your user query that gets fed into a model, so an LLM. The LLM is given a prompt, so the instructions that's given is don't give me the first answer that pops to you. 

Think slow, plan your work, and then try to execute something, try to act. And when you want to act, you can define whether if you want to use external tools to help you come up with the solution. Once you get, you call a tool and you get an answer, maybe it gave you the wrong answer or it came up with an error. You can observe that. So the LLM would observe the answer, would determine if it does answer the question at hand, or whether it needs to iterate on the plan and tackle it differently up until I get to a final answer. So let's go back and make this very concrete again. Let's talk about my vacation example. 

And as you can tell I'm really excited to go on one, so I want to take the rest of my vacation days. I'm planning to go on to Florida next month. I'm planning on being outdoors a lot and I'm prone to burning. So I want to know what is the number of two ounce sunscreen bottles that I should bring with me. And this is a complex problem, there's a number of things to plan. One is how many vacation days am I planning to take? And maybe that is information the system can retrieve from its memory, because I asked that question before. 

Two is how many hours do I plan to be in the sun? I said I plan to be in there a lot. So maybe that would mean looking into the weather forecast for next month in Florida and seeing what is the average sun hours that are expected. Three is maybe going to a public health website to understand what is the recommended dosage of sunscreen per hour in the sun. And then four, doing some math to be able to determine how much of that sunscreen fits into two ounce bottles. So that's quite complicated. But what's really powerful here is there's so many paths that can be explored in order to solve a problem. 

So this makes the system quite modular, and I can hit it with much more complex problems. So going back to the concept of compound AI systems, compound AI systems are here to stay. What we're going to observe this year is that they're going to become more agentic. The way that I like to think about it is you have a sliding scale of LLM autonomy, and you would, the person defining the system would examine what trade offs they want in terms of autonomy in the system for certain problems, especially problems that are narrow, well defined, so you don't expect someone to ask about the weather when they mean to ask about vacations. So a narrow problem set, you can define a narrow system like this one. It's more efficient to go the programmatic route because every single query will be answered the same way. If I were to apply the agentic approach here, there might be unnecessarily looping and iteration. 

So for narrow problems, programmatic approach can be more efficient than going the agentic route. But if I expect to have a system accomplish very complex tasks, like say, trying to solve GitHub issues independently and handle a variety of queries, a spectrum of queries. This is where an agentic route could be helpful because it would take you too much effort to configure every single path in the system. And we're still in the early days of agentic systems. We're seeing rapid progress when you combine the effects of system design with agentic behavior. And, of course, you will have a human in the loop in most cases, as the accuracy is improving.

## Robotics and Automation
Welcome to robotics and automation. After watching this video, you will be able to define the term robotics and how robots work. You will further discuss how AI technologies are integrated into robotics. You will also be able to examine how robotics enable automation in various industries. Lastly, you will explore the concept of robotic process automation or RPA and its applications. Across the industrial world, companies are investing heavily in robotics and automation. With the advancement of technology, robots have become more capable of performing complex tasks that were previously done by humans. 

This shift is driven by the need for higher productivity, improved quality, and the ability to operate continuously. According to a recent global industrial robotic survey conducted by McKenzie, many industries plan to spend 25% of their budgets on automated systems over the next four years. Let us understand the term robotics and how it enables automation. Robotics involves designing, constructing, and operating robots, machines that can perform tasks by themselves or with some help. Robots are complex systems made up of several key components, sensors, actuators, and controllers. Sensors act as the robots eyes and ears, gathering information about the environment. For instance, a camera sensor helps a robot navigate by capturing images and detecting obstacles. 

While temperature sensors ensure the robot operates within safe limits. Actuators are the robots muscles, enabling movement and interaction with the environment. This includes electric motors which move robotic arms and wheels, and hydraulic and pneumatic actuators, which control various parts of the robot. Controllers act as the robot's brain and run software that determines the robot's actions. For instance, in a robotic arm, the controller interprets sensor data and directs the motors to move the arm accurately. Robots use these components and work around various AI technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing or NLP to enable automation. Let's explore a few such examples. 

A robot vacuum cleaner uses AI to clean your home efficiently. It has sensors to detect dirt, walls, and furniture, and an AI controller to map your home and choose the best cleaning path. The actuators adjust the vacuums wheels and brush to clean surfaces, such as carpets and hardwood floors. A smart lawn mower uses machine learning to mow your lawn efficiently. It has sensors to detect grass height, obstacles, and lawn boundaries. The controller learns the lawns layout and grass growth patterns to optimize mowing routes and schedules. The actuators adjust the mowers wheels and blades to ensure an even cut. 

A voice activated smart speaker robot uses NLP to understand and respond to your spoken commands. It has microphones as sensors to capture your voice, an NLP controller to process and understand language, and actuators to perform actions like playing music, providing updates, or controlling smart home devices. Did you know that these devices act as self operating robots that do not need human intervention? As they can figure things out on their own? Let's discuss more such examples. Space exploration and deep sea exploration, find use of self operating robots. Space rovers, like the ones on Mars, explore other planets, collect valuable information, and send it back to Earth all by themselves. 

Similarly, underwater drones explore deep parts of the ocean, collect samples, and do research in places that are hard for people to reach. Robots working directly alongside humans are known as cobots or collaborative robots. Unlike traditional robots, cobots are designed to interact directly with people, making automation more accessible and versatile. Cobots are equipped with advanced sensors and AI technologies, allowing them to communicate and coordinate their actions to complete tasks that require teamwork. For instance, in automobile manufacturing, one cobot can hold a part in place while the other welds it, ensuring precision and speed. In logistics, cobots can work together to sort and move packages efficiently. Robotics uses AI to enable automation in many industries. 

In health care, surgical robots perform precise operations, reducing recovery times and improving patient outcomes. Rehabilitation robots help patients recover mobility and strength, offering personalized therapy. Agriculture robots plant, harvest, and monitor crops with precision, boosting yields and reducing waste. They optimize irrigation, apply fertilizers accurately, and monitor crop health in real time. In retail, self checkout kiosks and robots manage inventory and assist customers, streamlining operations, and improving customer service. This reduces wait times and ensures stock availability. Let's now discuss another concept called robotic process automation or RPA. 

RPA is a type of computer software that helps create, use, and control virtual robots. These robots act like humans when they work with digital systems and software. A PEGA system survey among 500 decision makers employing a range of RPA solutions revealed, 63% view RPA as a major component of overall digital transformation, 23% said it is the most important component, whereas 14% said it is a minor component. RPA can automate repetitive and rule-based tasks across various industries. In finance and accounting, RPA automates invoice processing by capturing, validating, and posting invoices. It also manages payroll calculations, deductions, and payments, and generates financial reports by extracting data from multiple sources. In human resources, RPA streamlines employ onboarding by collecting documents, entering data, and setting up profiles, leave management by handling leave requests and updating records, recruitment by screening resumes, scheduling interviews, and sending communication. 

In this video, you learn that robotics involves designing, constructing, and operating robots to perform tasks with or without humans. It utilizes sensors to observe processors for decision making, actuators for movement, integrating technologies like AI, machine learning, and NLP for automation. Further, you learned about cobots, which collaborate with humans using advanced sensors and AI, communicating and coordinating tasks that require teamwork. Lastly, you learned that robotic process automation or RPA automates repetitive tasks and helps create, use, and control virtual robots.

## Transforming Businesses Through AI
Welcome to transforming businesses through AI. After watching this video, you will be able to recognize how AI is transforming business operations and identify how various industries use AI to improve efficiency. AI is the game changer that is revolutionizing business operations with smart workflow automation, powerful data analysis, and efficient decision making. This transformation is helping companies achieve new levels of success and stay competitive in fast paced markets. Accenture predicted that AI in business operations would double workforce efficiency and boost profitability by an impressive 38% over the next 10 years. Organizations handle a wide array of tasks on a daily basis. AI automates repetitive tasks like data entry, scheduling, and report generation, allowing employees to focus more on creative and strategic work. 

Depending on which tasks you're looking to automate, a wide range of AI tools are available. For example, in customer service, AI chat bots understand natural language and customer sentiment to offer personalized support. Helping businesses resolve issues faster and making customers happy. AI chat bots are also more budget-friendly than human agents, saving businesses money. Take AirHelp, for example. This global service uses AI to assist airline passengers with flight statuses, delivering speedy and cost efficient customer service that boosts satisfaction and strengthens their brand reputation. Recruitment, AI tools analyze resumes and video interviews to find the best candidates. 

This helps businesses to fill positions faster, reduce productivity gaps, and ensure quality hires. Hilton's AI chat bot accelerates hiring by answering candidates questions and scheduling interviews, saving HRs time, and potentially lowering costs. In accounting, AI platforms automate payroll and auditing. This helps businesses in reducing the risk of human error in manual processes, leading to enhanced accuracy. For instance, EY has transformed auditing using AI to evaluate fraud risks and spot hidden patterns. So EY can catch financial misstatements early, keeping clients and investors safe and sound. AI allows businesses to make informed decisions by swiftly analyzing large data volumes. 

It identifies patterns and trends that help to predict outcomes based on the history of data. This leads to fewer errors. AI-driven tools offer real-time analytics and dashboards, helping organizations monitor performance and identify improvement opportunities. In marketing and sales, AI tools analyze purchasing patterns and suggest items based on customer purchases and browsing history. This boosts sales and conversions, leading to higher customer satisfaction. Amazon uses AI for personalized recommendations and inventory management. This reduces the risk of stock-outs and ensures they have the right products in stock. 

Ultimately boosting sales and customer satisfaction. In manufacturing, AI tools aid in predictive maintenance by using sensors and data analysis to monitor equipment, preventing costly breakdowns. This allows businesses to schedule maintenance proactively, and avoid catastrophic equipment failures. For instance, BMW uses AI to inspect parts on the production line, quickly spotting quality issues. This helps BMW produce higher quality cars more efficiently. Similarly, in health care and research, AI accelerates drug discovery and development by analyzing medical data, helping businesses develop successful drugs faster. For example, IBM's healthcare technology uses AI to analyze large volumes of medical data, providing insights for genomic analysis and disease diagnosis. 

This attracts new clients and strengthens IBM's reputation in the healthcare industry. AI is enhancing creativity in businesses by generating innovative ideas and overcoming creative blocks. This helps businesses resonate with their target audience, leading to higher engagement and increased sales. For example, in design and marketing, AI helps designers create personalized and user friendly designs through exploration, leading to happier customers and increased sales. Canva's magic design feature suggests layouts, color schemes, and fonts, based on content type and user preferences. This enhances their user experience and keeps people engaged with Canva. These capabilities are just a glimpse of the many ways AI is utilized in business. 

From creating operational efficiency and elevating customer experience to achieving significant cost savings, the benefits of AI are far reaching. In this video, you learn that AI automates repetitive tasks for businesses, like data entry, scheduling, and report generation, and allows employees to focus more on creative and strategic work. AI enables businesses to swiftly analyze large data volumes by identifying patterns and trends, leading to fewer errors and better predictions. AI generates innovative ideas and overcomes creative blocks by helping businesses resonate with the target audience, leading to higher engagement and sales.

## The Rise of Generative AI for Business
Welcome to the video on the Rise of Generative AI for Business. After watching this video, you will be able to recognize the transformative impact of Generative AI on businesses and identify its practical applications in various business contexts. Businesses are hitting remarkable milestones and transforming technology at its application by harnessing Generative AI. Let's see what some experts have to say about Generative AI. Arthur C Clarke famously said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Perhaps the first time that you played with Generative AI, it did evoke a sense of magic. Suddenly, for the first time in our history, we have technology that can speak our languages, understand our requests, and produce entirely novel output. 

AI can write poetry and draw other worldly images. It can write code. It can surprise and delight us with an original joke or musical composition. It can create, and an act of creation often inspires wonder. AI isn't just about the digital world. It's also about the physical world. Applied properly. imagine what AI can do for the pace of discovery and innovation, what it can do for discovering new materials, for medicine, for energy, for climate, and so many of the pressing challenges that we face as a species. 

Ultimately, our success depends on how we approach AI. A survey by JP Morgan indicates that investors predict the highest generative AI technology adoption in marketing at 28%, followed by legal services and insurance at 21%, media at 20%, data analytics at 18%, and consumer technology at 13%. This indicates significant transformations ahead for these industries. In the modern business landscape, companies are constantly grappling with the need to be more efficient, innovative, and customer-centric. Let's explore some key areas in businesses where generative AI is making contributions. Businesses often face the constant need for latest content, be it marketing material, product descriptions, or social media posts. Generating high quality content can be time consuming and resource-intensive. 

Here, Generative AI platforms step in as game changers as they can analyze the target audience data to create unique and engaging content. This helps organizations overcome creative blocks and maximize their reach and impact among the audience. For example, Persado, a Generative AI platform, helped Vanguard boost their sales conversion rates by 15%. Vanguard leveraged Persado to find the perfect phrases that captivate customers and crafted messages with the right emotion and action. This enabled them to deliver impactful content and seamlessly integrate data-driven insights into their marketing strategy. Another challenge is that businesses gather enormous amounts of data, but transforming this information into actionable insights can be overwhelming. Generative AI analyzes complex datasets to identify hidden patterns and generate reports translating data into actionable insights. 

According to a survey by Deloitte, employees leveraging generative AI save 1.75 hours daily, which equates to a full workday each week. For example, Salesforce integrated Generative AI capabilities into its CRM platform to analyze customer data and enhance sales and marketing strategies. This helped their sales team identify leads, predict customer behavior, and personalize interactions to improve conversion rates. Traditional customer service can be frustrating for both customers and agents. Repetitive tasks, like answering questions or basic troubleshooting hinder their ability to address complex issues. Generative AI-powered chatbots can handle repetitive tasks, providing fast and personalized answers to frequently ask questions. Additionally, AI can analyze customer data and suggest real-time troubleshooting steps, empowering agents to resolve issues efficiently. 

For example, Sephora is leveraging Generative AI capabilities to deliver personalized beauty recommendations. When a customer shops at Sephora, their preferences, purchase history, and even skin tone and concerns are logged into a database. Generative AI helps process this data to craft personalized emails that suggest products specifically recommended for that customer. Product development teams often struggle with limited design options and the slow iterative prototyping process. Generative AI models can produce multiple variations, enabling companies to shortlist the most appealing options. Nike, for instance, uses Generative AI to innovate its product design process. By feeding data on materials, biomechanics, and fashion trends, it helps generate numerous design possibilities. 

Not only big companies, but also startups are leveraging the potential of Generative AI. Young startups often struggle with limited resources and tight budgets. Creative content development, and product designs can be a significant expense for them. With the help of Generative AI technology, the team members need not focus on mundane and repetitive tasks, but on strategic planning and refinement. Along with cost effectiveness and increased efficiency, the early adoption of Generative AI also provides a competitive advantage to startups. For example, Stitch Fix, a full stack startup, uses GenAI to help stylists interpret customer feedback and provide product recommendations. While these are just a few examples, the possibilities with Generative AI are constantly evolving. 

As it matures, the benefits will likely become even more significant. The focus is now on practical ways to use Generative AI while addressing its challenges, leading to more sustainable, responsible and creative applications in various industries. In this video, you learned that businesses are leveraging Generative AI in several key areas. Some of them include content generation, where Generative AI can create high quality content, such as marketing materials, product descriptions, and social media posts; data analysis, where generative AI identifies patterns and generates actionable insights; customer service, where Generative AI-powered chat bots handle repetitive tasks and provide personalized answers, improving customer satisfaction; and product development where AI models generate multiple design variations, streamlining the prototyping process. Finally, you learn that startups are also leveraging Generative AI as it helps with cost effectiveness and increased efficiency and innovation.

## Become a Value Creator with Generative AI
When oxygen, heat, and fuel combine, we get fire. It's basic, it's primal, and it's the key that unlocked human progress. Fire provided light, and heat, and protection. With fire, our ancestors could move to new climates and eat new foods. Pottery, metallurgy, chemistry, rapid transportation, and many other technologies all start with fire. But imagine if fire had been proprietary. What if that knowledge hadn't been shared? 

What if there had been just a few keepers of the fire? What would we be? My name is Dario Gil, and I'm Senior Vice President at IBM and the Director of IBM Research. We are in a landmark moment now with generative AI that will shape our society for generations to come. Chances are you're already an AI user. Even if you don't have a formal AI initiative or an AI team in place, it's already in use across your business. It might be baked into your off-the-shelf applications. 

It may show up in chatbots, in HR self-service portals, and transcription services. These are what we might call traditional AI. The focus is on executing discrete tasks, and usually, each instance is trained individually on its own data that you had to compile and label. Now, what makes generative AI different is that it is enormously flexible and not limited to narrow tasks. Think of it as, instead of filling specific blanks, it can write the whole document from scratch to the point of being able to create or generate something entirely new. What makes this possible are foundation models. Foundation models aren't trained the same way as traditional AI. 

They're trained using self-supervised learning. You don't have to manually annotate a massive amount of data. You tell them to go read enormous amounts of text, and they do. You end up with a large but versatile model with more human-like language capabilities. Algorithms use mathematical models to represent the relationships between the words they ingest. If you give the model a few words in a prompt, it can mathematically predict the likelihood of words in the response. Instead of needing to build one AI model for each specific task, you can train one model and adapt it to many very downstream tasks. 

We went from one task, one model, to one model, many tasks. Your chatbot and your HR self-service can be built on the same model as the new app that will write your marketing emails and summarize legal documents. That's the first critical point. Ideally, a model is in the final form of AI is just the foundation you build on. How you use it is up to you. When it comes to using AI, there are basically three modes of consumption. The first is embedded AI, and is baked into off-the-shelf software. 

The software vendor creates the AI, and you put it to use in your business. Whether it's a writing assistant that can help you strike the right tone in your email or image editing software that can automatically process your images, you get access to some great functionality that can make you more productive, which we always want. But the caveat is that what you can buy, so can everybody else. Those capabilities and productivity opportunities don't become differentiators. They set a new higher baseline for everyone. The second model of consumption is through API calls. As you develop custom applications for your business, they can call out to another company's AI service using that company's models and processes and then return the results. 

This is also a viable way of consuming AI. Depending on how cleverly you use the APIs and the diversity of AI service providers you use, you can start to differentiate how you put AI to work relative to your competitors. But there are caveats here, too. The first is that, like with software, the models and services you tap into are available to everyone. The second is that when that API call goes out, it's connecting to what looks like a black box. You don't necessarily know what's happening on the other end or the provenance and governance of the data used, which can make people nervous because your business is still accountable for the final outcomes. A second word of caution when using someone else's AI has to do with the creation and accrual of value over the long term. 

In the past, we've seen a lot of value-extractive business models. Another company will offer you a service, like this API call, and you get value from that. But the other company is also extracting value from your usage and from your data, accumulating more and more. How much faster is their value growing than yours? Well, you can see it in the stock prices over time. There is an imbalance in the relationship that can have long-term consequences both for your specific business and for the overall economy and progress of technology. The third model of AI consumption is the platform model. 

This is the most comprehensive. This is how you become your own AI fire starter. No, it doesn't mean doing it alone, and reinventing AI from scratch, and spending years and millions of dollars to build your own models. With a platform, you have all the elements and ingredients in place to build your own AI solutions. You have foundation models. You have tools to improve and customize models, and you have processes to build your own tailored AI solutions. Importantly, you create an accrue value that is unique to your business. 

Ultimately, I believe that most businesses should end up with a mix of all three. You'll use third-party software with AI embedded. Sometimes, it'll be totally appropriate to use someone else's AI. But to fully realize the value of AI and to differentiate yourself from competitors, you'll want a platform approach to create and own your AI. Let me just go a bit deeper on AI value creation, starting with foundation models. Foundation models are large-scale deep neural networks trained with lots of unlabeled data and subsequently adapted to many downstream tasks. It may be a broad general model, or it may be a narrow deeper model. 

But the key is that it is pre-trained with the expectation that you can further enhance it with your own proprietary data. Like when a new employee joins your business, they come in with some general skills as a foundation and the ability to learn. The more they learn about your business, the more they add institutional knowledge and expertise, the more value they deliver. Well, the same is basically true of a foundation model. You use your AI platform to tune it with your specific business data, your proprietary knowledge and expertise, and it becomes more expert and more valuable for your business over time. Because you're in control of the platform, and the processes, and the data, you accrue ever-larger amount of value over time. With some of the consumer AI on the market, we've already seen some of what happens when you surrender that control. 

You can get bad data that leads to bad outcomes. You can get hallucinations, basically, AI generating very confident and very incorrect answers. You can get into some trouble for inadvertently using someone else's rights-managed content. We've even seen proprietary or sensitive data being inadvertently leaked back into the public spaces. That's why you need to know how your model is built and what data was included. It's why tight control of your sensitive data should be prioritized. Strong AI governance is absolutely critical. 

Yes, now it is the time to jump into AI, but please look before you leap in and ensure that you're investing in a smart, safe, and sustainable approach where your business and your clients and customers are the primary beneficiaries. There is, I think, a myth about AI right now, a basic misunderstanding. For the general public, generative AI has seemingly come out of nowhere. A lot of people think that there is a handful of consumer-oriented AI experiences out there, and that one model is going to win or just a few leaders. I don't think that that's how it's going to play out. The future of AI is not about one model. It's multi-model. 

Your business will be using multiple fine-tuned models to achieve the best results when applied to specific use cases. That's why the platform approach is so important. Realistically, the future of AI is not only proprietary. It will also be powered by open science and open source. Proprietary models will play a part, but so much of what is going to happen in the future will not happen behind closed doors. It will play out in plain view with full transparency and accountability that open source provides. The energy in the open-source community is phenomenal. 

They are distributed projects, university projects, corporate efforts, all driving innovation, producing foundation models that you can tune and deploy for your use cases. Hugging Face is like GitHub for foundation models, and there are over 325,000 open-source models available, and thousands more being added. This is exactly how it should be. For the good of society in the long term, we don't want just one or a few winners, a few companies that can define what AI is and dictate how it's used. But that's not going to happen. What we're going to see is the democratization of AI. I've talked about a lot of different topics, and I basically told you that you have a lot of work to do to be great at AI, and maybe that feels overwhelming. 

But really, that's not my intention. My goal is to take down barriers to participation, not put them up. There is a sense of urgency and fear about waiting too long and missing the moment. That's okay. I assure you that everybody is in the same situation, feeling the same emotions. But I promise that if, instead of rushing into fast and easy options to check the box and say, "Yes, I put AI in the business," if instead, you're thoughtful, and deliberate, and strategic about an AI platform, and data management, and AI governance, if you become an AI value creator, you're going to be in a position to succeed over the long term. You won't have to start over every time the wind changes direction. 

You may not have all the products and processes you need today. You may not have all the skills in place. That's fine. If you're not ready to start alone, find a partner that you can trust and get to work so that you can take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities that generative AI will unlock for your business. Personally, I'm very excited about this chapter in technology. We, all of us together, are going to use AI to reshape not just our digital world, but our physical world. We are going to use it to help tackle some of our toughest social, medical, environmental problems, and more. 

We'll do it through science but also by empowering businesses like yours and mine to do more, faster, and more responsibly. Whatever things you do, you're going to get a powerful new tool to help you do them better, and it's the AI value creators that will be the ones who make the biggest impact. It is the value creators who will take the amazing foundational technology that is generative AI and use it to build entirely new solutions. That's why it is our goal to make AI accessible to everyone, to put it in your hands. I can't wait to see what you will do with it.

## What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Large language models, they are everywhere. They get some things amazingly right and other things very interestingly wrong. My name is Marina Danilevsky. I am a senior research scientist here at IBM research, and I want to tell you about a framework to help large language models be more accurate and more up to date. Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Let's just talk about the generation part for a minute. So forget the retrieval augmented. 

So the generation, this refers to large language models, or LLMs, that generate text in response to a user query referred to as a prompt. These models can have some undesirable behavior. I want to tell you an anecdote to illustrate this. So, my kids, they recently asked me this question, in our solar system, what planet has the most moons? And my response was, that's really great that you're asking me this question. I loved space when I was your age. Of course, that was like 30 years ago. 

But I know this. I read an article, and the article said that it was Jupiter and 88 moons. So that's the answer. Now, actually, there's a couple of things wrong with my answer. First of all, I have no source to support what I'm saying. So even though I confidently said I read an article, I know the answer. I'm not sourcing it. 

I'm giving the answer off the top of my head. And also, I actually haven't kept up with this for a while. And my answer is out of date. So we have two problems here. One is no source. And the second problem is that I am out of date. And these, in fact, are two behaviors that are often observed as problematic when interacting with large language models. 

They are LLM challenges. Now, what would have happened if I'd taken a beat and first gone and looked up the answer on a reputable source like NASA? Well, then I would have been able to say, okay, so the answer is Saturn with 146 moons. And in fact, this keeps changing because scientists keep on discovering more and more moons. So I have now grounded my answer in something more believable. I have not hallucinated or made up an answer. And by the way, I didn't leak personal information about how long ago it's been since I was obsessed with space. 

All right, so what does this have to do with large language models? Well, how would a large language model have answered this question? So let's say that I have a user asking this question about moons. A large language model would confidently say, okay, I have been trained. And from what I know in my parameters during my training, the answer is Jupiter. The answer is wrong. But we don't know. 

The large language model is very confident in what it answered. Now, what happens when you add this retrieval augmented part here? What does that mean? That means that now, instead of just relying on what the LLM knows, we are adding a content store. This could be open like the Internet, this could be closed like some collection of documents, collection of policies, whatever. The point though now is that the LLM first goes and talks to the content store and says, hey, can you retrieve from me information that is relevant to what the user's query was? And now with this retriever augmented answer, it's not Jupiter anymore, we know that it is Saturn. 

What does this look like? Well, first, user prompts the LLM with their question. They say, this is what my question was. And originally, if we're just talking to a generative model, the generative model says, okay, I know the response. Here it is. Here's my response. But now, in the RAG framework, the generative model actually has an instruction that says, no, no, no, first go and retrieve relevant content. 

Combine that with the user's question, and only then generate the answer. So the prompt now has three parts. The instruction to pay attention to the retrieved content together with the user's question, now give a response. And in fact, now you can give evidence for why your response was what it was. So now hopefully you can see how does RAG help the two LLM challenges that I had mentioned before? So, first of all, I'll start with the out of date part. Now, instead of having to retrain your model, if new information comes up, like, hey, we found some more moons now to Jupiter again, maybe sadder again. 

In the future, all you have to do is you augment your data store with new information, updated information. So now, the next time that a user comes and asks the question, we're ready, we just go ahead and retrieve the most up to date information. The second problem, source. Well, the large language model is now being instructed to pay attention to primary source data before giving its response, and in fact, now being able to give evidence. This makes it less likely to hallucinate or to leak data because it is less likely to rely only on information that it learned during training. It also allows us to get the model to have a behavior that can be very positive, which is knowing when to say, I don't know. If the user's question cannot be reliably answered based on your data store, the model should say, I don't know. 

Well, instead of making up something that is believable and may mislead the user. This can have a negative effect as well, though, because if the retriever is not sufficiently good to give the large language model the best, most highest quality grounding information, then maybe the user's query that is answerable doesn't get an answer.

## Frameworks for AI Adoption
Welcome to the Frameworks for AI Adoption. After watching this video, you'll be able to explain the framework developed and used by IBM to adopt AI for business needs and explore the shift from a +AI to an AI+ approach to adopting AI. Organizations are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence or AI to drive innovation and gain a competitive edge. However, successfully harnessing the power of AI can be challenging. To address this, organizations are turning to AI adoption frameworks to guide their AI implementation efforts. These frameworks provide a structured approach to identifying the right use cases, aligning AI initiatives with business goals, and creating a culture that supports responsible AI development and deployment. One comprehensive framework designed to guide enterprises through this transformative journey is the IBM AI ladder. 

The IBM AI ladder is a structured framework that navigates organizations from basic data collection to full-scale AI integration across four key stages: collect, organize, analyze, and infuse. Let's understand each of these stages in detail. The initial stage, collect, involves gathering and storing high-quality data from diverse sources. IBM tools like the IBM Cloud and Watsonx.data facilitate this process. The key actions include identifying data sources such as databases and IoT devices, implementing collection tools, and ensuring data quality. For instance, a retail company uses Watsonx.data to gather sales data from various channels. The next stage in the IBM AI ladder is organize. 

This stage focuses on cleaning, categorizing, and making data accessible for analysis. IBM Cloud Pak for data, IBM InfoSphere, IBM DataOps, and IBM watsonx.governance, help with data management, governance, and security. Actions include cleansing data, categorizing it for easy retrieval, implementing governance policies, and centralizing storage. In the analyze stage, AI's potential is harnessed through advanced analytics and machine learning models. IBM tools like SPSS, Cognos Analytics, Watson Machine Learning, and IBM watsonx.ai enable efficient model building, testing, and deployment. Activities include applying statistical and machine learning algorithms, developing predictive models, visualizing insights, and refining models based on performance. For example, data scientists use watsonx.ai to analyze customer behavior. 

Finally, the infuse stage integrates AI into daily business operations to enhance decision-making and automate tasks. IBM watsonx APIs, RPA, and Cloud Pak for automation are helpful in embedding AI models, automating processes, monitoring models in real time, and training employees in AI utilization. For instance, AI insights were integrated into customer relationship management or CRM systems to automate marketing campaigns and optimize inventory management. The IBM AI ladder framework is versatile. It transforms data into actionable insights and strategies, supporting industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail. In the current business landscape, where AI is becoming increasingly prevalent, company leaders need to shift their mindset and move away from the +AI model, where AI is used as a supplementary tool, and instead embrace the AI+ approach, where AI is integrated holistically. This means they need to move from merely incorporating AI into their existing workflows, which only provide limited, incremental advantages to a more comprehensive approach, where AI is a core part of the business, not just a supporting tool. 

This involves designing business processes with AI as a fundamental component from the outset, rather than as an afterthought or add-on. Let us understand the shift in detail. The AI+ approach works towards a holistic integration process. This means that AI should be seamlessly integrated across all business functions. It involves embedding AI into product innovation, enhancing operational efficiency, and fostering a culture that embraces AI-driven decision making. The goal is to make AI a core part of the organization's DNA, influencing every aspect of the business from strategy to execution. Then the focus should be on identifying high value AI use cases that can deliver significant returns on investment. 

Begin with projects with clear, measurable outcomes, and the potential for substantial impact. Once these initial projects demonstrate success, scale them across the organization. This approach ensures that AI investments are strategically aligned with business goals and provide tangible benefits. Another crucial step is selecting the appropriate AI technologies and architectures for successful integration. This involves evaluating different AI tools and platforms to ensure they align with the businesses specific needs and goals. It is essential for the right technology to be scalable and flexible. Further, a robust data foundation is essential for effective AI implementation. 

This includes ensuring that the data is trustworthy, transparent, and well-governed. High quality data is critical for training AI models accurately and making reliable predictions. Additionally, organizations should comply with data privacy and security regulations to avoid legal and ethical issues. Finally, it is important for organizations to continuously innovate by developing new AI applications and modernizing existing ones. Leveraging a hybrid Cloud platform can provide the necessary flexibility and scalability to support ongoing AI initiatives. Continuous improvement and adaptation ensure that AI solutions remain relevant and effective in addressing evolving business challenges. In this video, you learned about the IBM AI ladder, a framework to adopt AI that involves the four key stages of collect, make data simple and accessible, organize, create a business ready analytics foundation, analyze, build and scale AI with trust and transparency, and infuse, operationalize AI throughout the business. 

You also gained insights into adopting an AI+ approach that involves holistic integration, identifying use cases, choosing the right AI technology, robust data foundation, and continuous innovation and modernization.

## Humans vs. AI: Who should make the decision?
A decision needs to be made. But who should make it. Me a human, or an artificial intelligence, and AI? We've discussed before that humans can outperform AI at some tasks, but that statistically, AI will make a better job of deciding for other tasks. So for one single decision, who should decide? Well, the answer is a fascinating combination of holistic curves and human bias. Let's get into it. Consider a fraud detection system. 

Fraud detection. The system generates the alerts of potentially fraudulent transactions. Financial analysts review each alert. Now, there's thousands of events generated each day and the analysts are overwhelmed with 90% of those alerts being false positives. An AI system could help alleviate the workload, but which alerts should the AI handle and which should be processed by a skilled financial analyst? Well, let's draw a graph to answer the question, is this a real alert? Let's draw a graph of an x and a y axis. 

The y axis tracks the success rate. An alert comes in, we make a prediction as to if it is real or not, and we track if that prediction turn out to be right. Along the X axis is the confidence score. A confidence score of 0% says a prediction thinks that this is definitely not a real alert. It's a false positive. Confidence score of 100% means that a prediction is certain that it is a real alert. Now, a typical AI performance curve will look something like this. 

We've got very low confidence scores. This is not a real alert, and very high confidence scores. This is a real alert. They're correlated to a high success rate. That's these areas up here. When the AI is not sure about a given prediction, then it's not such a case. Lower success rate when the AI is not sure. 

It's effectively the AI algorithm saying, I don't know. Now, human performance curves are typically a little bit flatter than that. So the human performance curve might look something like this. Often not quite as accurate as a very confident AI algorithm, but a little better at making the right decision when the AI is unsure. At a 50% confidence level, a human is likely to do a better job than an AI. Now, why is that? Well, when an AI is certain of itself, it's highly performant and beats out humans who can lose consistency and focus on attention. 

AIs, they don't get distracted. But on the other hand, when an AI is unsure, often for cases that are complex or statistically rare, humans can outperform an AI prediction by bringing in additional information and context. They can look stuff up or ask a colleague, whereas the AI sticks to its same old decision logic and information. When a new alert comes in, if the AI assigns a high or a low confidence level, then chances are that statistically speaking, it will do a better job of deriving if that alert is real or a false positive, than a given financial analyst. But this is not a zero sum game. It doesn't have to be AI or human. We have one more option. 

Augmented. Augmented intelligence combines both a human decision aided by AI. This performance curve falls somewhere between the two. For somewhat low and for somewhat high confidence scores which make up a significant number of predictions, it's augmented intelligence that will have the highest success rate. Except. For augmented intelligence to be most effective, we need to account for the messy business of human cognitive bias. We're not always great at doing what we're told. 

It turns out that how we present information from an AI algorithm to a human decision maker, has a significant influence on how effectively that information is used. To illustrate that, let's consider forced display versus optional display. A forced display simultaneously displays an AI recommendation along with a given decision case. For every fraud decision alert that I need to make a decision about, I as the analyst, also see the AI's recommendation. And this can lead to something called automation bias, which is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision making systems and to ignore contradictory information. Effectively, the human decision maker is saying, the AI knows best, and going with the AI prediction at the expense of their own judgment. Optional display means the AI recommendation is only shown to the human decision maker when they request it. 

A person sees a decision case and can then ask the AI to reveal its recommendation. This overcomes automation bias by giving a person time to consider the case for themselves before consulting an AI recommendation. The human is not overwhelmingly influenced by what the AI thinks, because they've had a chance to make up their own first impression. Then there's the whole issue of trust too. When an AI recommendation is accompanied by an accuracy percentage which indicates how likely this prediction is to be correct, humans are less likely to incorporate the AI recommendation into their decision regardless of the accuracy percentage being displayed. Basically, we don't like recommendations that openly tell us that they might be wrong. We've seen that who should make a decision, a human, an AI or a human assisted by an AI recommendation is something that we can derive. 

We can move from subjective decisions to the quantifiable that for a given decision, who the most effective decision maker is likely to be. When the most effective decision maker is a combination of AI in human, that's augmented intelligence, we must consider presentation of that augmentation to minimize human cognitive bias in the decision making process. Brought together, us humans and AI algorithms make a pretty powerful team. We can improve decision making outcomes if we just know who to ask.
