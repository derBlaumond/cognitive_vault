### JavaScript: First contact
 
- Let's say you're completely new to web development. If you go on the web and look for tools, tutorials and code examples for building a website or application, there's a very good chance the first thing you'll come across is something built using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue, Angular, Svelte, or something like that. We're in a new era of web development where JavaScript is becoming the primary language for everything both in the browser, on the server and even on your own computer. Those good old days of building websites using HTML and CSS and just a sprinkling of JavaScript are well behind us, and the new technology stack is built around JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks. Today, learning JavaScript so you can go out and use it right now means learning modern JavaScript and modern JavaScript tooling and learning how to decipher and understand things like JSX and TypeScript so you're able to recognize and work with frameworks like React. With this in mind, I've structured this course to give you the tools you need to navigate this rapidly evolving landscape. So rather than start with the simple stuff and then slowly building things up, we're going to start with relatively complex things and pick them apart to understand what's happening, how things work and how to work with modern JavaScript. This approach, taking something complex, breaking it down and then building your own versions of it is the best approach to learning new things and keeping yourself current. And by following this course, you'll habituate yourself to this learning process. So let's start that process right now. This is a typical React component. This is what you'll likely encounter when you go out on the web and try to build something today. And looking at it, even I need a moment to figure out what on earth is going on. Now here's the thing. This is not pure JavaScript, this is JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript created for the React JavaScript framework. Which begs the question, if I'm going to work with React, should I just learn JSX then? The answer is no. You should definitely learn JavaScript first. JSX is an extension, so you still need the basics, and if you understand the basics, you'll quickly pick up JSX and other JavaScript flavors as well. This React component has a ton of different parts we'll discuss in depth in this course. Objects and methods, functions, template literals, arrays, we'll cover it all. And at the end of the course, we'll return to this component and you'll see once you have the basics down, you'll be able to make sense of this component even without knowing React or JSX.

### Navigating the JS landscape
 
- [Instructor] When you look around for information about JavaScript and feel a bit overwhelmed by all the different things with the label JavaScript associated with them, you're not alone. There's Vanilla JavaScript and then there's ECMAScript and ES6 and ES2015 and ES2017 and ES2020 and TypeScript and CoffeeScript, and then there's React and Vue and Angular and Gulp and Babel and WebPack and Node.js. And somehow all of these things are related to or under the umbrella of JavaScript. And everyone is saying, "You should learn this first, no, this first, no, this first, no, that other thing first". The JavaScript landscape is evolving rapidly because JavaScript has become such an essential part of the web platform and all of these different things and names encapsulate a discrete aspect of the language itself or how it's implemented or how it's worked with or a tool or framework built on or used with JavaScript. So to make sense of all of this, here is Morten's incomplete guide to navigating the JavaScript landscape. First off, at the core of all of this sits JavaScript itself, often colloquially referred to as Vanilla JavaScript. This is the scripting language itself and the scripting language for the web. This is what you write when you write JavaScript and what we'll cover in this course, everything else is built on top of JavaScript itself, Vanilla JavaScript or JavaScript Proper. The browser implementation specification for JavaScript is called ECMAScript, named after the European Computer Manufacturers Association, ECMA. This group is in charge of defining the specification for JavaScript. Now ECMAScript is not the language itself, but the official description of how the language should be interpreted by browsers. This is meant to ensure that when you write JavaScript, it behaves the same way no matter what browser is used. When people say they write ECMAScript or ES6 or 2015 or 2017 or 2020 or something like that, they usually mean they're writing JavaScript that is at the cutting edge of development, effectively, the JavaScript of the future. When people write some version of ECMAScript, they typically use a tool called Babel to convert their code back into JavaScript the current browser can read. JavaScript is an opinionated coding language and some developers either don't like JavaScript's opinions or they need specific features not provided by JavaScript. To get around this issue, they've developed abstracted versions of JavaScript with these additional features added. The most popular of these is TypeScript. TypeScript is heavily used in modern JavaScript frameworks. And you can usually spot TypeScript by looking at the file name. TypeScript files typically have the .ts file name extension. Think of TypeScript and CoffeeScript and all the variations of JavaScript as dialects of JavaScript. The modern web runs on JavaScript frameworks. These are tools written in JavaScript to render content on the web in the form of applications. The most popular of these frameworks are React or React.js, Vue or Vue.js and Angular or AngularJS. They all add an abstraction layer on top of JavaScript to do things in a more streamlined and efficient way. As an example, React uses JSX or JavaScript XML which simplifies how we mix JavaScript and HTML. With JavaScript frameworks come build the tools. These are helper applications, typically automated that run on your computer or in the cloud to turn your human written and readable JavaScript code into code optimized for the browser. I've already mentioned Babel. Other common tools include NPM, WebPack, Grunt, Gulp and so on. Finally, in the last several years, JavaScript has migrated from the browser to the server, so we can now write Java JavaScript to run on the backend as well as the front end of our applications. Node.js is the ubiquitous JavaScript server runtime used for this purpose. And when you work with modern JavaScript, you'll be interfacing with Node.js on your computer all the time, through the Node package manager or NPM. Considering all of this, here is your takeaway. JavaScript is the core underlying language for anything and everything we've just talked about. And understanding pure vanilla JavaScript is the key to understanding all this other stuff. So learn JavaScript first, then specialize and optimize your knowledge.

### Tools for working with JavaScript
 
- [Instructor] To work effectively with JavaScript, you need a couple of tools on hand on your computer. First of all, you need a modern browser and ideally you want to install all the browsers that are available for your operating system, but you should pick one as your primary browser. Throughout this course, I'll be using Chrome. You can also use Firefox or Edge. They will pretty much work the same way. Second, you need a code editor. Again, here, you can choose whatever tool fits, your particular work environment. The industry standard is quickly becoming VS Code. It's free and you can download it off the web, but you can also use any other code editor. The key here is to find a code editor that will highlight your code as you work with it. For efficiency and for everything to work properly, the code editor needs some form of live server environment. So this essentially is an application that sits on your code editor that spins up a live web server on your computer so that the files you work on a computer, behave as if they're sitting on a proper web server. This is essential for JavaScript to work correctly and for your sites to be able to interact with JavaScript the way your computer on your browser wants to do if the site is on the web. Finally, you need a browser console. All the modern browsers have a browser console, but how to get to it varies a little bit. I'll show you all of this in the browser so you can see how it all fits together. First off, like I said, you need the browser. So here we have Chrome and Chrome has all the tools inside the browser that we need to work with in the browser. In addition, you need a code editor. If you don't already have one, I suggest you go download Visual Studio Code. You can get it for free for any operating systems. You can have it on Windows or Mac OS or Linux or whatever else you want. Once you've installed Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor, also make sure you have a live server extension to the code editor. In Visual Studio Code, you should just use this one called Live Server. If you go to Visual Studio Code and click on this button over here, the one with the blocks, you can install new extensions. You just go search for Live Server. You find this extension here and you install it. Once Live Server is installed, you'll see down here on the blue bar on the bottom, you have this Go Live button. And if you open the exercise files folder that has all the different folders for all the different movies and just click Go Live, the browser will automatically open on the entire exercise files projects. So here, you can get access to every single movie and every single set of exercise files directly from within the browser as if all of this code was sitting somewhere on the web. So it'll work properly in your browser. You can see it. If we open 0105, for instance, here's functioning code in the browser. And then we come to that last part, the console. If you go and Chrome or Firefox and you just right click anywhere on the screen and click Inspect, you'll open the code inspector. So here you can inspect the code and see what's happening. What we care about is the console and the console you can get to it either by clicking the console option here or by hitting the Escape button on your keyboard, it'll open the console or close the console. And from this console, you can directly interact with the JavaScript on the page. We'll cover all of that in more detail later. So for now, make sure you have a modern browser, a code editor, a live server environment, and then you know how to gain access to the browser console in your browser.

### Linting and formatting
 
- [Instructor] Take it from me, the dyslectic coder. Writing code without any errors is not easy. And writing code that is consistently formatted so all indentations are the same and the code conventions and guides are followed correctly is also not easy. To help with all of this, your code editor has a bunch of useful tools built in including automatic syntax highlighting, which is what you see if I open a file here. The color coding that indicates the different types of content that are in this file. And other features like automagically cleaning up your indentation and so on. To help us write cleanly formatted code without too many errors, we can also add to the functionality of the code editor using extensions. In this example, we'll add in two new extensions. ESLint and Prettier. And you can install them both directly from Inside VS Code by going to the extensions option just searching for ESLint and installing it and then searching for Prettier and installing. It looks like this, and it looks like this. The Prettier code format does exactly what the name suggests, this makes the formatting of your code prettier for your human eyes. So that all your indentations are correct. So that all your parentheses are lined up properly and things just look clean when you're working with a code. It sounds really finicky to use a tool like this but the reality is it makes it easier to work with your code, especially if you're working with other people because all the code will be formatted the same way. ESLint is sort of like a spellcheck but for JavaScript. It lints, as in goes through your code and finds all the lint and takes it out. So it goes and checks your code to make sure that you're following the conventions or the standards that you've applied to the code. It's a really useful tool to tell you when you're doing things incorrectly, or when there, standards that need to be followed in a different way. And again, it helps you make sure your code is consistent. Now for these two tools to work, we need to install the necessary settings and the necessary automated background functions. And that's done using Node.js. Now, remember how I said when you work with modern JavaScript, you end up working with Node.js, the JavaScript server runtime. That's exactly what we are going to do right here right now. Oh, and by the way, if you don't want to do this, you don't have to. These tools are not required to be able to follow along in this course, but I encourage you to install them because they will make your experience working with JavaScript much more enjoyable. And these types of tools are essential to your future work with JavaScript. Okay. To get all this to work, you need to have Node installed on your computer. If you're using Mac OS, you likely have Node already installed. If you're on Windows, you likely need to install it. Node can be installed directly from nodejs.org, where you'll also find all the installation instructions for your operating system. Once Node is installed on your computer, we need to install the extensions that allow Prettier and ESLint to work properly. Now, these extensions have already been configured inside the exercise files for this project. However, you need to install them into your computer. That's done by going to the terminal inside VS code. To get to the terminal, you can either go to view and select terminal or simply hit control and backtick on your keyboard. The terminal is a command line for the computer. So here you can do things like install new extensions. The only thing you need to do from terminal is once you've navigated to the exercise files folder and you see what I'm seeing on my screen here, type in npm install. Now the Node package manager goes onto the internet, finds the dependencies necessary, pulls them into my computer through the internet and installs them in our current project. You can see it here at the bottom of my project, I now have a new folder called node modules that contains all of the dependencies that were installed. These dependencies are literally dependencies for everything to work. In this case for Prettier and ESLint to work. So that means when you start a new project, you can install dependencies for just that project. If you want to learn more about node and dependencies and npm, we have entire courses in the library focusing on that in particular. And I encourage you to go check out those courses after you're finished watching this course. But for now, we have all the pieces we need. There's one last little piece of this puzzle to get everything to work properly. That is to go to file and then to preferences and settings. And from here, search for formatsonsave. Make sure that this option is checked. It's probably not, so you need to check it. All that happens when you do this is anytime you save a file, Prettier and ESLint kick in. Check over all your content, format the content, if necessary and then save the file. Now that we've done this, we can check to see if it works. So if you go to the exercise files and go to 01_05, that's the next movie. I can take a preview right now. Then you go into script.js and you'll see there are no warnings. There's no errors in the script right now. So let's introduce an error. We'll take something away. And you can see all these red lines. Uh-oh, something's wrong. If we hover over any one of them, it'll tell you comma is expected. Here will say comma expected again. It's because I took away that equal sign. So that's ESLint in a nutshell. It goes in and tells you, hey, hey, hey, something is wrong. Let me fix it. The other thing is Prettier. So if I reformat my code here, so I'll take away the parentheses and I'll take away the quotation mark and I'll do some indentation here. So the code is now messy from a standard's perspective. Now watch what happens when I save this file. Prettier now kicks in and automatically cleans up my code. So it adds the parentheses back. It cleans up my indentation and it adds that semicolon. And this is the purpose of these tools. So if you imagine you work in a team and you have a specific set of coding standards. Let's say in your team, you don't want to have semicolons at the end of any line, you make a rule for it and then Prettier will enforce the rules. So if someone adds semicolon, Prettier takes it away. And, or on the other hand, if you're using a standard that says semicolons should be there and people don't add the semicolon, Prettier comes in and adds the semicolon for you. So now with Prettier and ESLint, you have fully automated code cleanup and code linting.

### Get to know the browser console
 
- [Instructor] The browser console is the JavaScript developers' best friend, alongside the code editor and linting tools and automation tools. And, okay, so the JavaScript developer has a lot of best friends, and the browser console is one of them. When you write JavaScript, you work in a code editor. The problem is, the JavaScript doesn't run in the code editor, it runs in the browser. So you need some way of interacting with the JavaScript directly inside the browser. And that's what the console is for. Just like when you work with HTML and CSS, you can open the developer tools and mess with the HTML or change the CSS in some way, and see what happens right away in the browser. Console is the exact same thing, but for Java script. Let me show you how it works. Go to VSCode and go to the exercise files for this movie, 01_05. And you'll see, there's a file here called scriptjs that has some JavaScript in it. We're not covering this JavaScript just yet. We just want to see what happens in the console. So go down to the bottom right-hand corner, click Go Live to open the browser. The site is not running in the browser, and we can go to the current folder, 01_05. And here you see a very basic HTML document with just some texts, all right. Now we need to open the browser console. The browser console is appended to the developer tools. So when you open the developer tools, you gain access to the console as well. Right now, when I've opened the tools, you can see the console on the bottom here. If you don't see it, you can hit the Escape key on your keyboard, and it'll open and close the console. You can also go to the console directly from the menu at the top here by selecting console. And it'll take you just to the console and nothing else. From here, we have access to everything that's happening in the browser right now. That is what we're seeing in the HTML. We also have access to the actual browser window. We can manipulate the browser window in different ways. So for example, I can say something like window document, and this will give me the entire document in the window. So if I open this, you'll see, oh, here we have HTML. So if we go into the body, you'll see in the body we have a main, and in the main we have a div, and in the div we have an h3, and an unordered list, and an unordered list, right? So the console actually gives me full access to everything that's happening in the browser. And I can now experiment with it and mess around with it, but I'm not going to work with the window document object just now. Instead, I want to take a look at something that I supplied using my JavaScript. So I'll go back to my JavaScript file. And here you see there's a constant called backpack. What happens if I go to the console and just type in backpack? First of all, you'll notice as I'm typing, the console goes, "I think I know what you're saying here." So it gives me everything that kind of matches what I'm typing out, because it's guessing ahead. And you can immediately see there's something in the console called backpack. So I'll just hit the right key to get all the way to the end of that, and get it to auto complete, and then hit return. What I get in return now is a response from the console. And the response is the backpack object. So here you see, color gray, lidOpen false, name, Everyday Backpack. In my code, color gray, name, Everyday Backpack, lidOpen false. Now the order is not the same because this is in alphabetical order, but the content is the same. So that means this thing that I wrote in JavaScript is available to me directly inside the console. And that's kind of the whole point. Now I can look at what's available here, and see, is there's something I can do here? Well, some of this information is just information, like it says, let's see, lidOpen false. So it's telling me that the lid is currently closed, and you can see it up here it says top lid closed. So there's also a function here. This f tells me this is a function that's called toggleLid. And it says, toggleLid function, lidStatus. So without looking at the code, I think I should be able to send a command to a function called toggleLid, and then pass a new status to it and something should happen. So I'll try that just from within the console. This is, I'm kind of experimenting with the code, saying I don't know it, let's see how it works. So I'll say backpack. And then I'm looking for that toggle, so I'll say toggleLid. See, the auto-complete automatically suggested for me, hit Enter to go in there. And then it says lidStatus. Okay, so I'll try to just pass a new status. The current lidStatus is false, so let's set it to true and see what happens. Hit return, and we get two things. We get this text that says lid status changed. And then up here in top lid, it now says open, cool. And if I now go and say backpack one more time, you'll see when I open up this object, it now says lidOpen true. So in the console, I made a change to the JavaScript object and the JavaScript object somehow interacted with the HTML in my document and made a change. If I jump back to the code here, you can see what happened. So I used this toggleLid function, you see it's a function, that captures the lid status. So I set it to true. Then it says this object has the lidOpen status, matched that. And then it calls a new function called updateBackpack that sits up here. And the updateBackpack function grabs my update and then updates the HTML in the document, innerHTML, and also console info's out the updates. So that's why you're seeing this lid status changed. That's the text that you saw down here, lid status changed. Now, of course, I just crashed through a whole bunch of JavaScripts that you don't know yet. And that's fine, we'll go through all of this in great detail in the next couple of movies. But what I wanted to show you here is, just like we have the code on the backend inside the code editor., we also have access to all the stuff that's happening in the code editor inside the browser itself, through the console. And this is where we can debug our code and figure out exactly what's going on. We'll be using the console extensively throughout the rest of the course. So familiarize yourself with how to open it. That's all you need to know for now, how to open the console and how to clear it by clicking this button here or whatever it is for the current browser you're using. As we move forward, we'll use the console and I'll explain to you how it works as I use it.

### JavaScript language basics
 
- [Instructor] JavaScript has some very basic language basics worth knowing about. First, write your JavaScript from top to bottom because that's how the browser will read it. A good rule of thumb here is to define all variables and functions and objects and anything else before you use them, so higher up in the file. That way you know the browser has read the object or the function or whatever it is before you call it, otherwise you might run into problems. Second, comments, like what you see at the top here are used to leave literal comments for yourself and other humans to explain what's going on. When you create a comment it is ignored entirely by the browser, so it's purely there for us humans. In my code editor right now with the color settings you can see comments are colored green. They'll always have a different color from other code and it's always consistent in the way you see here. To leave a single line comments in JavaScript, you use two forward slashes and then just the string of text that is the comment. You can do that on its own line and you can also do it inside another line of code. So, here we have a declaration for a let and then we have a comment directly afterwards. Just remember everything behind the two forward slashes will always be the comment. If you need multiline comments, you use CSS comment syntax. So, forward slash asterisk to start the multiline and asterisk forward slash to end then you can add as many lines of texts as you want in between these two markers. If you are using a code editor like VS Code, there's also a shorthand for a more verbose type of comment. Down here I have a function called updates backpack and if I enter forward slash and then two asterisks and then hit return, VS Code will create a verbose comment for me and even capture that this function has a parameter called update. It will then ask me what type of data is in updates, I'll say string and then I can fill in this comment. And here you see the purpose of a comment. Now, when I come back to the code I'll see there's a function here, it's called update backpack, it outputs HTML and it has a single parameter, it's a string and it's called the update. Comments are also often used to quickly activate or deactivate single or multiple lines of code for debugging purposes. This is done by placing your cursor on the line or lines you want to comment out and then hitting control or command forward slash. So, if I hit control forward slash I comment out this line of code, if I do it again, so control or command forward slash, I uncomment this line. If I want multiple lines I just highlight the lines and again, control or command forward slash to comment them out, control or command forward slash to take the comment away. It's a very quick and easy way of doing debugging. Third, spacing or white space. In JavaScript, spacing is purely for the human user. That means the browser does not care about spacing at all. You can write all your JavaScript in a single line and the browser will still understand, but humans will not. So, it's better to use spacing properly. The best practice is to use indentation to visualize hierarchy. You can see that down here we have a constant called backpack and then inside we've indented all the pieces that go inside and there's some further indentation to show what the hierarchy is. Now, you may have heard a joke or two about tabs versus spaces. This indentation is what those jokes refer to. You see at the top here, this indentation currently is two spaces. Now, that joke used to make sense because you had to add either tabs or spaces manually to do indentation, but today this is all handled automatically by the editor. So, if you see down here, it says, "tab size four." So that means if I hit return here and then hit tab, here we have a single tab and it's four spaces wide. If I want to change that I'll go into my code editor and say, "I want to indent using spaces," and then say how wide I want the indentation to be, two. And then you see the indentation I created is automatically changed. So that way, no matter what the indentation is for a document you can always just convert it using the code editor. And there's more, if you're using a tool like Prettier this will be sorted out for you, so you don't even have to think about it. Fourth, semicolons, you'll notice that I add semicolons at the end of all my declarations and you'll also notice that Prettier will enforce this standard. Now, some developers will add semicolon to the end of declarations, others will not. Again, JavaScript does not care either way. This is a coding and syntax preference for us humans. In some coding standards, you are required to add coding, add the semicolons, in others, you aren't required to not add them. The good news is, ESLint and Prettier will sort this out for you. So, if you go look at code examples and you see either using or not using semicolons, know that this is just a preference. If anyone ever tells you it's wrong to do one or the other, that's simply not true. This is purely editor preference and the tools we use will automatically sort it out for you. Finally, quotation marks. You'll notice, in my code I use double quotes for all strings. This again, is developer preference. Some developers like to use double quotes, some like to use single quotes and different coding standards will enforce different styles. So, in some coding standards, single quotes will be enforced and apply of using ESLint and Prettier, in others you'll have double quotes and the same thing will happen. So, just be consistent in what you're doing and the tools will figure out the rest for you. The rule of thumb to all of this is, number one, be consistent and number two, use tools like ESLint and Prettier to automate this consistency.

### Learning JavaScript backward
 
- When you learn JavaScript for the first time you typically start with the basics, variables then functions, then more advanced subjects. But, due to the popularity of JavaScript frameworks, like React and View, today the first introduction people have to JavaScript is often through advanced objects and methods. For this reason, I've chosen to turn our course on its head. We'll start with objects and methods, then look at other data types and the DOM, and finally cover methods, functions, and events at the very end. This means, as we make our way through the course, I'll often introduce and use concepts before I fully cover them, so you see them in the real context first and then learn the basics later. And there's a good reason for this. Learning JavaScript requires not just understanding the basic premises and shapes and formulas of the code. To really learn this language, you need to find ways of making it make sense to you. Think of your mind as a shelf, like the one behind me. I could just hand you a bunch of items of information about how the language works but then they'd likely just end up being stacked in front of the shelf or randomly wherever there's room. I want to help you to figure out where each of these learning items go on your shelf. And that's why you'll be introduced to advanced examples first. You see the context and you'll start asking questions about why things work that way and why they do what they do. Then I'll give you the item with the answer or explanation to each of those questions and you'll know where to place them on your shelf. To help strengthen this learning process, I've added open-ended practice assignments throughout the course, so you can practice and play around with what you've learned immediately. I encourage you to dive into these practice assignments and spend some time on them so you really get a feel for the language. I've also added ample references to the official JavaScript documentation at MDN Web Docs, both in the course, in the exercise files, and in a downloadable document. As you start working with JavaScript, reading and referring to the MDN Web Docs will become part of your process, and as you move through this course, I want you to check out the links I provided, explore the examples they provide, and make this documentation part of your learning journey. That way, when you come out the other end of the course, you've already established a documentation based practice that will serve you as a robust platform for your continued learning. So, if you feel lost at any point, that's all part of the learning process. I encourage you to stop the movie and watch it again, or go check out the linked MDN documentation for the current subject, or skip to the next movie to see if there's an explanation coming, or dive into one of the practice assignments to explore the problem and find a solution that makes sense to you.
